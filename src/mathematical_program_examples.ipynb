    "One area of optimization tools offered in pydrake is the MathematicalProgram interface.  MathematicalProgram is a class that abstracts many different useful types of optimization solvers.  This makes it so from one interface, you can access many different solvers.  The MathematicalProgram component of Drake is comparable to CVX or YALMIP in the MATLAB ecosystem, or JuMP, in the Julia ecosystem. To get a concise overview of which solvers are supported for which different types of optimization problems, check out [this chart](http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we provide enough sample code to familiarize you with the tool and give you a sense of how to solve simple problems. If you're curious to dig deeper, take a look at the [Technical C++ Doxygen Documention](http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1solvers_1_1_mathematical_program.html), and the [C++ source code](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/solvers/mathematical_program.h).\n",

    "- Once you construct a MathematicalProgram object, i.e. `mp = MathematicalProgram()`, the tab completion in your jupyter notebook can be very helpful.  \n",

    "- An additional resource for how to use MathematicalProgram is the tests written for it. There are a significant amount of tests for MathematicalProgram, written in C++.  See [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/solvers/test/mathematical_program_test.cc) but also other tests in that folder.  Occasionally you will still find a C++ feature that does not yet have pydrake bindings -- for those familiar with pybind, the bindings for MathematicalProgram are generated [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/bindings/pydrake/solvers/mathematicalprogram_py.cc), and are demonstrated in numerous tests [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/bindings/pydrake/solvers/test).
